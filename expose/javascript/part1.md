1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. The line throws an error, since the `let` keyword in JavaScript limits the scope of the variable to the block in which it is defined. Therefore, `result` is only accessible within the if block.
5. The `result` variable is declared as a const (constant), which means it cannot be reassigned after its initial declaration. The line `result = num1 + num2;` attempts to reassign a new value to `result`, which is not allowed for constants.
6. The code throws the error above then the variable `result` is trying to be reassigned, and therefore does not reach this line.
